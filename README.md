## Challenge

I have challenged myself to create my first bigger project using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

In this project I decided to think of a design on my own, which despite being challenging, was also enjoyable.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript

### Future plans

Study more on basics of UX/UI so that it can be implemented for better usability.

Improve JavaScript skills as well as working on writing cleaner code.
